# CRYPTOGRAPHY-ALGORITHMS
Caesar Cipher: One of the simplest and earliest known encryption techniques, the Caesar Cipher involves shifting each letter of the plaintext a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

Playfair Cipher: An advanced digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters (bigrams or digraphs) instead of single letters, providing more security than simple substitution ciphers.

One-Time Pad (OTP): A highly secure encryption technique that involves using a random, one-time key of the same length as the message. As long as the key remains truly random and is never reused, the encryption is considered unbreakable.

RSA Algorithm: A widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm for secure data transmission. It involves the use of a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The security of RSA is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem.

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange: A secure method of exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. It allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure medium without any prior secrets. The security of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange relies on the discrete logarithm problem.
